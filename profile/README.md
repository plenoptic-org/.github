plenoptic is a python library for model-based synthesis of perceptual stimuli, intended for researchers in neuroscience, psychology, and machine learning. The stimuli generated by plenoptic enable interpretation of model properties through features that are enhanced, suppressed, or discarded.

üíª The [main code repo is here](https://github.com/plenoptic-org/plenoptic).
